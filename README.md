# Sub-vocab

Learn the vocabulary/sentences in English materials before watching/reading them.

You can enter English material, such as English subtitles or an article, and the program will output all the words in a list that will be divided into two categories: words you already know and words you need to learn.

After you log in, you may mark the words you already know by clicking on the checkboxes, or click again to delete the words you don't know. You can find all the words you have marked as acquainted in the *Mine* section.
